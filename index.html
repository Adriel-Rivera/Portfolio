    <h2 class="section">About Me</h2>
      <p class="normal"> 
      I grew up homeschooled as an only child. My dad and I are Singaporean Citizens whereas my mom is PR. My first friends are from church which I got accustomed to going to every Sunday with family, attending Sunday school. We regularly visit our relatives in the Philippines for vacations. My mom invested a lot of her time taking care of me and eventually home schooled me until my Primary 6 level (present).

      <p class="normal">
      I’ve been homeschooled ever since my preschool days. Mom has invested a lot of time teaching/coaching me and eventually homeschooled me until Primary 6 (present). I started Primary 1 at six years old and have been studying a year advanced ever since. As I progressed through my studies, I grew more independent and relied less on my mom, but still turned to her for help and she finds remarkably effective learning resources for me.

        My dad works as an IT, so it was only natural that programming piqued my interest. As I grew more fascinated with coding, my dad had me learn how to use Scratch, which is a beginner’s programming language that serves as a good introduction to coding. It involves combining pre-made blocks of code to create instructions for the computer to follow. As I progressed through Scratch, I learned the basic principles of programming and how exactly everything works. As much as how enthralling Scratch can be, the things you could create with it had its limits, so I began learning Python. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Here I learned syntax-based coding. Instead of dragging and dropping blocks around, I had to create the blocks, allowing more versatility and creativity. This time, with more typing involved rather than clicking and dragging, I learned more about variables, functions, classes and more. However, at that point, my goal as to what exactly I wanted to do with coding wasn’t very clear. After surfing the internet for coding tutorials and whatnot, a few game development youtubers popped up in my recommended section. After watching their videos, I was inspired to create a video game of my own. I immediately downloaded Unity, a game development engine. A game engine, also known as a game architecture, game framework or gameframe, is a software-development environment designed for people to build video games. I also started watching YouTube tutorials on C#, the optimal programming language for building video games. After leeching all the information I could find about gaming development off the internet, I decided to start  a project. I attempted making a 2D platformer RPG. However, after being overwhelmed by all the bugs and glitches, I scrapped the project and took a break from game development for a good while. After a nice, long break, I got back to it yet again, this time trying 3D games. I scrapped countless projects. Endless Runners, Puzzles, FPS Shooters, you name it. Eventually, I settled on a classic 3D RPG, similar to Monster Hunter. I worked hardest on this project, and I am quite satisfied by its outcome. I created a simple WASD Locomotion Controller, melee and ranged weapons with different damage outputs, an enemy AI that follows the player upon sight and attacks when in range, and even went as far as making a 3D Model for the character instead of using the default Unity “bean” which is what most game developer youtubers do. I created an open world environment with mountains, vegetation, villages, and castles. I have learned a lot throughout this programming learning journey, and I am currently working on further plans for this RPG: Weapons, Different variants of enemies, Levels, Spells and Abilities, Maps, Plot, and more
